{ 
    1 : Made project directory system and wrote a basic function to open a floating window. I followed 
        along with code from (https://dev.to/2nit/how-to-write-neovim-plugins-in-lua-5cca). I did this
        to learn the basics of opening a floating window.

    2 : For now, in order to test I need to always start neovim using (nvim --cmd "set rtp+=./") from 
        within this directory. Then within vim I can call my functions by using:
        (:lua require("todo")) and (:lua require("todo.todo").open_window())
}

{
    1 : Implemented a border window that closes with main window on close.

    2 : Tried to make a keymapping function to set up keymappings.

    3 : Going to using '<leader>td' to open my todo plugin.
}


-- 1/31/2023 --
{
    1 : Made an alias in (~/.bashrc) for (vim --cmd "set rtp+=./") now it is
        (vimtodo)

    2 : Made pretty borders.

    3 : Dove into reading ThePrimeagen's Harpoon plugin to see how that is 
        written.
}


-- 2/7/2023 --
{
    1 : Modularized code base for more readability. Made window.lua and 
        keymap.lua
}


-- 2/11/2023 --
{
    1 : Added my plugin in packer. This has allowed neovim to have my plugin 
        installed. Know neew for 'vimtodo' anymore.
}


-- 2/12/2023 --
{
    1 : Added a utils.lua file that has a module that can use vim funtions to 
        find the path to the current directory and file.
}


-- 2/16/2023 --
{
    1 : Fixed call when opening window so that it finds the path to the current
        file in the buffer.

    2 : Found vim.fs.find() which searchs a path for files or directories. I 
        could use this to search for .todo/ or .todo.txt or something.
}


-- 2/21/2023 --
{
    1 : Created a path_utils.lua to use for os path stuff.

    2 : Modularized codebase a bit more by making window its own folder.
        I need to make window a module.

    3 : Fixed buffers to close at the same time.
}


-- 2/22/2023 --
{
    1 : Made a dir_exists(directory, bufnr) in path_utils.lua
}


-- 2/26/2023 --
{
    1 : Made progress on creating a directory if one does not exist and am able 
        to open a todo.txt file within that directory. 

    2 : Made some updates to the look and size of the window within
        test_win_utils.lua. 

    3 : Overall, I feel pretty good. I am making good progress. Now I just need
        to make it look pretty.
