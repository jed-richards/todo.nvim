{ 
    1 : Made project directory system and wrote a basic function to open a floating window. I followed 
        along with code from (https://dev.to/2nit/how-to-write-neovim-plugins-in-lua-5cca). I did this
        to learn the basics of opening a floating window.

    2 : For now, in order to test I need to always start neovim using (nvim --cmd "set rtp+=./") from 
        within this directory. Then within vim I can call my functions by using:
        (:lua require("todo")) and (:lua require("todo.todo").open_window())
}

{
    1 : Made an alias in (~/.bashrc) for (vim --cmd "set rtp+=./") now it is
        (vimtodo)

    2 : Made pretty borders.

    3 : Dove into reading ThePrimeagen's Harpoon plugin to see how that is 
        written.
