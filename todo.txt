{
    1 : Finish writing code from online and understand what it is doing.

    2 : Look into buffers and windows. Learn the basic vim navigation of them. 

    3 : Make my own implementation of opening and closing windows and the 
        overall look of them.

    4 : Look into this 

        timeHMS _ `[all]`
        ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
        I give you back the time (H:M:S)

        ${CURRENT_HOUR}:${CURRENT_MINUTE}:${CURRENT_SECOND}

{
    1 : Fix set_mappings() functions (set keymapping <leader>td to open todo 
        window)

    2 : Make a close window function and set key map to 'q' while in buffer 
        (nvim_buf_set_keymap())

    3 : Set up rtp so it knows to search here without using 
        'vim --cmd 'set rtp+=./'

    4 : Look into nerdfonts so i can make the border 'pretty'
}

{
    1 : Still need to work on keymaps with (set_mappings())

{
    1 : Idea for project and file storing -> crawl backwards in directory
        looking for .todo directory. This will allow for nesting. 
}

{
    1 : I need to make it so when I open a window with open_window() that I am
        able to have a variable with the path to the current directory and file
        of the previous buffer that the function was called in. 

    2 : Figure out how to make a directory and file.
