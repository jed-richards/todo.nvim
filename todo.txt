    3 : Make my own implementation of opening and closing windows and the overall look of them.

    4 : Look into this 

        timeHMS _ `[all]`

{
    1 : Fix set_mappings() functions (set keymapping <leader>td to open todo window)

    2 : Make a close window function and set key map to 'q' while in buffer (nvim_buf_set_keymap())

    3 : Set up rtp so it knows to search here without using 'vim --cmd 'set rtp+=./'

    4 : Look into nerdfonts so i can make the border 'pretty'
